# 🖌️ FloodFill
A programming assignment for UBC's CPSC 221.

This project demonstrates flood fill algorithms on PNG images using both **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approaches.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The application performs pixel-based flood filling using:
- Custom implementations of **stacks** and **queues**
- Flood fill logic powered by **DFS** and **BFS**
- Flexible **functors** to modify image pixels in various ways

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🚀 Efficient flood fill using DFS and BFS
- 🧱 Custom stack and queue data structures
- 🎨 Functor system to define pixel modification rules
- 🖼️ Visual comparison of flood fill results
