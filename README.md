# FloodFill
Programming assignment for UBC's CPSC221.

Uses a flood fill algorithms on inputted PNG images.

## Features:

Implementation of stacks and queues.

Implemented flood fill algorithms utilizing depth-first-search(DFS) and breadth-first-search(BFS) to locate desired pixels to change and various functors to change the pixels.

## Flood Fill Examples (BFS vs DFS):
